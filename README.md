Various scripts for automating UTAT's lab gear

## Contributing 
To keep code neat, please run the following commands before pushing new scripts (run `pip3 install -U black isort flake8` to install tools):
```
black . && isort . && flake8
```
This will reformat according to PEP8, and alert of any issues that can't be automatically resolved.
